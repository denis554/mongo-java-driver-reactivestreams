## MongoDB Reactive Streams Java Driver Documentation

Welcome to the MongoDB Reactive Streams Java driver documentation hub.

The Reactive Streams Driver is the canonical asynchronous Java driver for MongoDB, providing asynchronous stream processing with back 
pressure in line with the [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) specification. The API mirrors the now-deprecated 
callback-based [MongoDB Async Driver]({{< asyncDriver >}}). For reference documentation please see the asynchronous driver documentation.

Note that while the callback-based asynchronous driver is now deprecated, the MongoDB Reactive Streams Java
driver will continue to be supported. Once the callback-based driver has been removed, the MongoDB Reactive Streams Java
driver will be fully documented in its place

### Getting Started

The [Getting Started]({{< relref "getting-started/index.md" >}}) guide contains installation instructions
and a simple tutorial to get up  and running quickly.
